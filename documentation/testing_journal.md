# Kathy Peacock & Benjamin Loveday Final Project TESTING JOURNAL


## DAY 1 

- full team meeting all day, contributing ideas for project and narrowing down on MVP, explaining purpose and contributions of QE team. Setting some communication and requirements/requests from our side looking forward...

- decided on standards for bug reporting and enhancement suggestions etc. To that goal made templates for GitHub issues. We also contributed documentation of standards for git branch and commit naming conventions, and shared our perspectives on the importance of accessibility considerations from start.

- We talked about the importance of effective and clear element naming - HTML id etc - both for accessibility and test automation purposes.
 

## DAY 2 

- Finalising scope of MVP. Devs had conversation about styling, wanting to do it all at the very end. We were able to confidently push back and come to a compromise that everyone agreed with, explaining accessibility and UX implications and the need for us to at least have clear expectations/plan regarding styling before the last minute to raise questions/concerns/create plans etc.

- We sent over some 'designing with accessibility in mind' resources.

- The devs were made aware that we can create csv datasets etc, if necessary.

- We strongly pushed for a feature implementation roadmap so we don't raise unnecessary issues and bugs for features/functionality that are planned for future updates.

- The devs had not come up with a Spec, informal or otherwise - so, we worked towards this by creating a document containing expected user actions, and mainly consisting of assumptions and questions regarding features, functionality, display and UX details. This was then sorted into sections by PAGE and 
annotated as to whether it refers to Artist or Fan actions, or both. This was helpful in informing decision-making around artist/fan account, action and view distinctions. We went through the ARTIST PAGE section as a team (ie the MVP) making sure there was clear understanding for all around what is expected and when (ie Yes, No, Not Yet). This means we'll be able to plan tests accordingly, and preempt a lot for the devs.

- A BDD repo was created, including basic scenarios and step definitions for the MVP. (Gherkin .feature and step defs in Java) We can now flesh out BDD tests and documentation as we get more concrete user stories for new features.

- we discussed the suitability of different test techniques looking ahead, now we have a bit of spec clarity...
